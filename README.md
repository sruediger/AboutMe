#### [Versão em português](README_ptBR.md)
App created to show a bit of my resume and portfolio, made 100% in Swift implementing the MVVM architecture and using native libraries like SwiftUI to build all the interfaces.

## Features
The app is composed of a main screen with the following buttons that open their respective windows:
* Programming languages
* Skills 
* Applications
* Experiences
* Curiosities
* Contacts
### Other features and topics explored 
* MVVM architectural pattern and SwiftUI 
* Design Patterns
* Unit tests
* Interface testing 
* Dynamic Type
* Multi-language
* Adaptable interfaces (dark and light mode)

## Minimum Requisites
* Mac OS BigSur
* Xcode 13
* iOS/iPadOS 15.4

## How to run
* Download or clone the repository and open the Xcode project file (.xcodeproj).
* Compile and run the app by pressing ⌘B + ⌘R

### Testing
The backend and frontend unit tests are located in the UnitTests folder. To run them just press the ⌘U combination or open the files and choose the tests manually. Xcode's left sidebar known as the Navigator also allows you to view and run the tests and even see the coverage of each one in the Report Navigator item. 

The coverage of the backend tests in this version is 100% for all devices, while the frontend tests are over 80% for all devices due to the autolayout and screen sizes.   

Feel free to fork, modify, reverse engineer or use this repository as a template to make your own. Contributions are also very welcome!
